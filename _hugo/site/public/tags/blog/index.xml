      <description>Yup, a new shinny blog arises. For about two years now my blog is hosted by Umbler, they give you R$ 100,00 (one hundred brazilian reais) credit, so I decided to try it. Unfortunately they don&amp;rsquo;t offer support for Django/Flask (web frameworks for python) - and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem that they&amp;rsquo;ll do in the near future - hence I built the blog on Wordpress. My lazyness stops me from messing arround somethin that ain&amp;rsquo;t broke and the blog stood that way until now.</description>
