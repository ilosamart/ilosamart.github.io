Yup, a new shinny blog arises. For about two years now my blog is hosted by [Umbler](https://www.umbler.com), they give you _R$ 100,00_ (one hundred brazilian reais) credit, so I decided to try it. Unfortunately they don't offer support for Django/Flask (web frameworks for python) - and it doesn't seem that they'll do in the near future - hence I built the blog on Wordpress. My lazyness stops me from messing arround somethin that ain't broke and the blog stood that way until now.

But something changed. I've been a paid customer for the last year, the blog (with DNS servers) costs me six bucks per month (the cheapest plan they have) and now they'll charge eigth bucks (33% increase in price). Didn't feel right to me pay eigth bucks for a blog that nobody reads, but I needed the DNS servers for my domain (my family uses our custom domain for pure e-mail awesomeness).

Enters [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com) with their DNS. This service will cost me about R$ 1.80 per month, but my blog would still cost me the same eight bucks, so I had to bring it to a cheap service like... [GITHUB PAGES](https://pages.github.com)! So there's the new combo: Google Cloud DNS + Gihutb Pages with custom domain ;)

Well, that brings a problem, the CMS. I'm trying [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), let's see if it fits my needs wich are basically... generate a fucking blog nobody reads. So I guess anything would be a nice fit. Yeah... we'll be ok ;)
